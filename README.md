This is C++14 library for Lepestrum

It consist:
 - base types for platform specific features
 - C++14 std port with main memory less features
   - C++14 std type traits (almost implementation of features)
   - C++14 std types - support generic types
   - C++14 initializer list
   - C++14 algorithm (max and max_element only)
 - lepestrum bit manipulation types and helpers
   - C++14 Lepestrum elementary platform types
   - C++14 Lepestrum type list with type list operations, and traits
   - C++14 bit_field and bit operations markers
 - Compile and runtime based tests for everything components of library
